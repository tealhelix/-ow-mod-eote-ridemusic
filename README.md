<p>
Pirates of the Eye! This mod replaces the dour music coming from the house in the first dark area with the main theme from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney resorts.
<p/>
<p>
Smell the bromine in the water, feel the air conditioned breeze on your face, and watch your step as you walk onto the ride vehicle!
</p>

Past the house, or wherever you like, you can also play the music as background ambience.

### Ambient music control
| Key Combo | Description |
| :-: | --- |
`,` + `/` | Increase volume, starting play at min volume if it was off.
`,` + `.` | Decrease volume, stopping it if volume is now zero.

<p>
The music can be replaced with any sound loop of your choice by replacing the .mp3 file with one of the same name, or by editing a new name into config.json. Audio formats besides mp3 may work.
