Echoes of the Caribbean! This mod replaces the dour music coming from the house in the first dreamworld area with the main theme from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney resorts.<br />
Smell the bromine in the water, feel the air conditioned breeze on your face, and watch your step as you walk onto the ride vehicle!
<br /><br />
Past the house, or wherever you like, you can also play the music as background ambience using these keys:

`,` + `/` (Hold comma, hit slash): Increase ambient music volume, starting play at min volume if it was off.<br />
`,` + `.` (Hold comma, hit period): Decrease ambient music music volume, stopping it if volume is now zero.<br />
<br />
The music can be replaced with any sound loop of your choice by replacing the .mp3 file with one of the same name, or by editing a new name into config.json. Audio formats besides mp3 may work.
<br /><br />
The default music assets (raw and mixed version of the clip) in this project are copyrighted by Disney and are excluded from the MIT license. Videos containing these clips may be subject to auto-takedown. I don't intend to profit from this mod, please let us have our fun.
